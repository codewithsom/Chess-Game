### What Are The Chess Pieces?
- The chess pieces are what you move on a chessboard when playing a game ofchess. There are six different types of chess pieces. Each side starts with 16 pieces : Eight Pawns, Two Bishops, Two Knights, Two Rooks, One Queen, and One King.

### The Pawn :
- When a game begins, each side starts with eight pawns. White's pawns arelocated in the second rank, while Black's pawns are located in the seventh rank. Thepawn is the least powerful piece and is worth one point. If it is a pawn's ﬁrst move,it can move forward one or two squares. If a pawn has already moved, then it canmove forward just one square at a time. It attacks (or captures) each square diagonally to the left or right
### The Bishop : 
- Each side starts with two bishops, one on a light square and one on a darksquare. When a game begins, White's bishops are located on c1 and f1, whileBlack's bishops are located on c8 and f8. The bishop is considered a minor piece(like a knight) and is worth three points. A bishop can move diagonally as manysquares as it likes, as long as it is not blocked by its own pieces or an occupiedsquare. An easy way to remember how a bishop can move is that it moves like an"X" shape. It can capture an enemy piece by moving to the occupied square wherethe piece is located.
### The Knight :
- Each side starts with two knights—a king's knight and a queen's knight.When a game starts, White's knights are located on b1 and g1, while Black'sknights are located on b8 and g8. The knight is considered a minor piece (like abishop) and is worth three points. The knight is the only piece in chess that canjump over another piece! It moves one square left or right horizontally and then twosquares up or down vertically, OR it moves two squares left or right horizontally andthen one square up or down vertically—in other words, the knight moves in an"L-shape." The knight can capture only what it lands on, not what it jumps over!
### The Rook :
- Each side starts with two rooks, one on the queenside and one on thekingside. All four rooks are located in the corners of the board. White's rooks startthe game on a1 and h1, while Black's rooks are located on a8 and h8. The rook isconsidered a major piece (like the queen) and is worth ﬁve points. It can move asmany squares as it likes left or right horizontally, or as many squares as it likes up ordown vertically (as long as it isn't blocked by other pieces).
### The Queen :
- The queen is the most powerful chess piece! When a game begins, each sidestarts with one queen. The white queen is located on d1, while the black queen islocated on d8. The queen is considered a major piece (like a rook) and is worth ninepoints. It can move as many squares as it likes left or right horizontally, or as manysquares as it likes up or down vertically (like a rook). The queen can also move asmany squares as it likes diagonally (like a bishop).
### The King :
- The king is the most important chess piece. The goal of a game of chess is tocheckmate the king. When a game starts, each side has one king. White's king is located on e1, while Black's king starts on e8. The king is not a very powerful piece,as it can only move (or capture) one square in any direction. When a king is attacked, it is called a "check".
